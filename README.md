# IDE
A commandline based IDE made with Bash scripting!

We take an input to a variable 'code' at each iteration of the loop and append that input to the existing file. The control breaks out of the loop whenever the variable 
'code' is assigned the value "stop". The entire file is then compiled and exectuted using the javac and java commands respectively.
